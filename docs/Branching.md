# Branching
Branching is when you place labels in the code, and then jump around to the labels using either unconditionally or conditionally.

<br>

## Defining Labels
Define a label by putting a period, followed by the name of the label.
```
.test
<enter code here>
```

## Using labels
When passing a label name as a instruction argument, just put the name without the period.
```
jmp test
```
